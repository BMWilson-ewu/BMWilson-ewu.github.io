      <p>
        I am a passionate student of Computer Science at Eastern Washington
        University who is looking to improve my skills within both the 
        realms of programming and design. Difficult tasks fill me with 
        excitement as they present me with new challenges and skills to 
        learn, as well as new ways to improve my more practiced skills.<br/>
        <br/>
        I am most experienced with Java, but I also possess some experience 
        with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. During my time as a student, I 
        have worked with relational databases such as MySQL and SQLite,
        worked on GUI based Java applications, and worked to improve my 
        code using object oriented deign patterns whenever possible.
